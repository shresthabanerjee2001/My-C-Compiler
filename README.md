# Project Overview:
This compiler implements the core stages of compilation—from lexical analysis to code generation—for a subset of the C language. It is designed to handle standard C constructs, including variable declarations, control flow, and expression evaluation.

## Features:
## Lexical Analysis:
Tokenizes source code, handling identifiers, keywords, literals, and operators.

## Parsing:
Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on C grammar rules.

## Type Checking:
* Validates variable declarations and scope.

Enforces type safety in expressions.

## Enhanced Char Support:
specifically supports comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, etc.) for char types, allowing for robust character logic.

## Error Handling: 
Provides meaningful error messages for syntax and semantic errors.
